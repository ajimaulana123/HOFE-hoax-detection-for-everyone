# HOFE ( Hoax Detection For Everyone )

![Mockoup](Mockup.png)

## Background

Our project seeks to develop a Hoax Detection application, targeting the critical challenge of misinformation that pervades Indonesian media landscapes. Our problem statement focuses on the need for an automated and intelligent application capable of detecting and reducing the spread of misinformation, which increasingly threatens social harmony and public trust in vital areas such as health and governance. Although there are already similar applications available, we aim to achieve a highly reliable hoax detection accuracy. Through our research questions, we aim to determine the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in detecting hoaxes in real time and to identify key linguistic and contextual features that distinguish misinformation. Additionally, we investigate the broader implications of hoaxes on public opinion and decision-making.

In terms of background, Indonesia is witnessing a surge in hoaxes, with studies showing that a large portion of the population is exposed to false information, primarily through news articles. This unchecked spread has spurred public uncertainty and, in some cases, social unrest—particularly around health crises like COVID-19 and sensitive political events.
This tool will empower individuals to distinguish between truth and falsehood, promoting informed public discourse, bolstering confidence in credible news sources, and contributing to a well-informed society. This initiative reflects our commitment to addressing the misinformation crisis and to advancing media literacy through actionable technology.
